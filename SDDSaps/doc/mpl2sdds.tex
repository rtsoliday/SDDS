  \item \textbf{description:} Adds \verb|mpl| data files to an SDDS data set.
    \verb|mpl| is a simple data format used by the \verb|mpl| Toolkit, which is now largely
    superseded by SDDS and will not be supported in the future.
  \item \textbf{examples:}
    \begin{verbatim}
mpl2sdds APS_s_betax.out APS_s_betay.out -output=APSbetas.sdds
    \end{verbatim}
  \item \textbf{synopsis:}
    \begin{verbatim}
mpl2sdds mplFile [mplFile...] -output=SDDSFile [-erase]
    \end{verbatim}
  \item \textbf{files:}
    Any number of {\em mplFile} arguments may be given. These name files in {\tt mpl} format, which
    has between two and four columns of data. \verb|mpl2sdds| attempts to add all of the columns from
    each \verb|mpl| data file to the data set. However, a column that has the same name as an existing
    column will not be used. By default, the data in the {\tt mpl} files is added to {\em SDDSFile} if
    it exists already.
  \item \textbf{switches:}
    \begin{itemize}
      \item {\tt -output={\em SDDSFile}} --- Specifies that data be added to file {\em SDDSFile}. If the file does not exist, it is created.
      \item \verb|-erase| --- Specifies that if {\em SDDSFile} exists already, it should be erased prior to adding any data to the data set. By default, the data in {\em SDDSFile} is retained.
    \end{itemize}
