\subsection{SDDS Wildcard Conventions}
\label{SDDS Wildcard Conventions}

This manual page does not describe a program, but rather a facility that is common to several
programs.  In particular, several SDDS programs use a common convention for wildcards in
element names.

The characters \verb|*|, \verb|?|, \verb|[|, \verb|]|, and \verb| | are used for wildcard operations.

\item [] \verb|*| matches any zero or more characters.  A sequence like \verb|*a| matches zero or more
characters up to the first occurence of \verb|a|.

\item [] \verb|?| matches any one character.
\item [] \verb|[|{\em rangeSpec}\verb|]| matches any one character in {\em rangeSpec}.  {\em rangeSpec} is
 composed on any number of explicit characters, plus character ranges specified as {\em firstChar}\verb|-|{\em lastChar},
 which matches any character between  {\em firstChar} and {\em lastChar} inclusive in the ASCII character set.
 For example, \verb|[a-z]| would match a lower case alphabetic character, while \verb|[a-z][A-Z][0-9]| would
 match any alphanumeric character.

\item [] \verb|[ |{\em rangeSpec}\verb|]| matches any one character not in {\em rangeSpec}.
