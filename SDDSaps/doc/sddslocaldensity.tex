\label{sddslocaldensity} 
 
\begin{itemize} 
\item {\bf description:} \hspace*{1mm}\\ 
{\tt sddslocaldensity} the local density of points in n-dimensional space for each point in the space.
\item {\bf examples:} 
\begin{flushleft}{\tt
   sddslocaldensity <inputFile> <outputFile> -columns=none,x,y -kde=bins=40 -threads=20
}\end{flushleft} 
\item {\bf synopsis:}  
\begin{flushleft}
\begin{verbatim}
sddslocaldensity [<inputfile>] [<outputfile>] [-pipe=[input][,output]] [-threads=<number>]
\{-fraction=<value> | -spread=<value> | 
 -kde=bins=<number>[,gridoutput=<filename>][,nsigma=<value>][,explimit=<value>]
      [,sample=<fraction>|use=<number>]\}
-columns=<normalizationMode>,<name>[,...] [-output=<columnName>] [-verbose]
\end{verbatim}
\end{flushleft} 
\item {\bf files:} 
The input file contains a collection of points in n-dimensional space, defined by named columns.
The output file contains the same data, but with an additional column {\tt LocalDensity} that gives 
the density of points in the vicinity of each point.
\item {\bf switches:} 
  \begin{itemize} 
  \item {\tt -pipe[=input]} --- The standard SDDS Toolkit pipe option. 
  \item {\tt -columns={none|range|rms},{\em column1Name},{\em column2Name ...}} --- 
    Specifies the normalization mode and column names for analysis.
    Note that the normalization mode is irrelevant when fraction, spread, or kde options are used.
  \item {-fraction | -spread | -kde} --- Specify the calculation mode, if different from the default.
    Note that all methods except the KDE method show $N^2$ growth in run time, where $N$ is the number of points.
    \begin{itemize}
      \item By default, the ``local density'' for each point is the inverse of the mean distance to all other points.
      \item For {\tt -fraction=f} mode, the ``local density'' for each point is the number of points inside a distance $d_i$
        in dimension $i$, where $d_i = f*(\max(x_i) - \min(x_i))$.
      \item For {\tt -spread=f} mode, the ``local density'' for each point is the sum over all other points
        of the product of unnormalized gaussian pread functions in each dimensional, where the gaussian parameter
        is $\sigma = f*(\max(x_i) - \min(x_i))$. Since the gaussians are unnormalized, the result is roughly the
        number of nearby points.
      \item {\tt -kde=bins=<number>[,gridoutput=<filename>][,nsigma=<value>]}
        {\tt [,explimit=<value>][,sample=<fraction>|use=<number>]} ---
        Performs Kernel Density Estimation in n dimensions using the given number of bins in all dimensions, using
        Silverman's method to estimate the bandwidth in each dimension.
        The {\tt gridOutput} qualifier results in writing the density map to the named file.
        The {\tt nsigma} qualifier specifies truncation of contributions to the density outside the given number of
        bandwidths; it defaults to 5. The {\tt explimit} qualifier specifies a cutoff in the magnitude of $e^{-z^2/2}$ 
        for including contributions to the density; it defaults to $10^{-16}$. Setting {\tt nsigma} to a smaller value
        and {\tt explimit} to a larger value can significantly reduce run time with little impact on accuracy.
        The {\tt sample} and {\tt use} qualifiers allow reducing the number of input points used for computing the
        density map; this again can significantly reduce run time and may have little impact on results 
        if the number of input points is large; regardless of this setting, the estimated local density is output for
        every input point.
    \end{itemize}
  \item {\tt -threads={\em number}} --- Specify the number of threads to use for KDE-based computations. Defaults to 1.
    The speed-up is best when the number of KDE bins is relatively small or the number of dimensions is relatively small.
  \item {\tt -outputColumn={\em name}} --- Gives the name of the output column containing the ``local density.''
    Defaults to {\tt LocalDensity}.
  \item {\tt -verbose} --- If given, provides informational output during execution.
